When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
	When you're collaborating on a project with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	You might not want to incorparate all of the changes made by others without reviewing them first.

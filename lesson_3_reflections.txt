When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
	When you're collaborating on a project with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	You might not want to incorparate all of the changes made by others without reviewing them first.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	-branches live within a repository, whether local or on github. 
	-forks are made on github to build upon repositories started by others
	-clones are complete repositories pulled from github to a local machine
	-also clones are no use if you want eat with them unless it's clone of a fork. A tiny branch in the shape of a fork or a clone thereof would also do. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	you can check the remote changes and resolve conflocts before you merge everything
